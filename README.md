**üê∂ Pet Image Classifier - Udacity AI Programming with Python**

**Project Overview**

This project classifies pet images using a **pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It determines whether the images contain dogs and identifies their breeds using three different CNN models: **VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet**. The script compares the model predictions to the actual labels derived from filenames and generates a summary of performance statistics.

The project is structured to run via command-line scripts (.bat for Windows and .sh for Linux/macOS) to ensure automation and reproducibility.

**üöÄ Installation Guide**

This project was developed using **Python 3.11**. Before proceeding, ensure Python is installed on your system.

Open a terminal and verify your Python version:

python3 --version # macOS/Linux

python --version # Windows

If Python is not installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

1. **Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal **(Command Prompt/PowerShell for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux)** and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository (e.g., Downloads):

cd ~/Downloads # macOS/Linux

cd %USERPROFILE%\\Downloads # Windows

Clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/cvasilov1/udacity_AIPND_classify_pet_images.git>

Move into the project folder:

cd udacity_AIPND_classify_pet_images

**üìù Note for Git Bash** **users:**

Git Bash behaves similarly to macOS/Linux when running commands. If you are using **Git Bash on Windows**, generally follow the macOS/Linux commands, not the Windows-specific ones.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies**

You can set up your environment in two ways: Python Virtual Environment (venv) or Anaconda (conda).

**üîπ Option 1: Using Python's Built-in Virtual Environment (venv)**

For users not using Anaconda:

‚û° **macOS/Linux (from Terminal)**

python3 -m venv pet_env # Create virtual environment

source pet_env/bin/activate # Activate virtual environment

pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies

pip list # Verify installed packages

‚û° **Windows (from Command Prompt/PowerShell)**

python -m venv pet_env # Create virtual environment

pet_env\\Scripts\\activate # Activate virtual environment

pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies

pip list # Verify installed packages

**üîπ Option 2: Using Anaconda (from the Anaconda Prompt)**

conda create --name pet_env python=3.11 -y # Create virtual environment specifying the Python version

conda activate pet_env # Activate virtual environment

conda install --file requirements.txt # Install dependencies from Conda

conda list # Verify installed packages

**üìù Note for Git Bash** **users:**  

For Windows: Git Bash behaves like macOS/Linux, so use **source pet_env/bin/activate** instead of the Windows activation command.

For Anaconda: Git Bash supports conda activate, but you might need to enable it first with: **conda init bash**

**üìÇ How the Code Works**

**1Ô∏è. Running the Classification Script (check_images.py)**

There are **40 images** provided by Udacity in the **Location:** pet_images/

The core of this project is check_images.py, which:

1. **Extracts true pet labels** from the filenames of the 40 images.
2. **Uses a pre-trained CNN** (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG) to classify images.
3. **Compares the predicted label to the actual pet label.**
4. **Determines if the classified image is a dog or not** using the provided list of breeds dognames.txt.
5. **Generates statistics** on accuracy, including:
    - Percentage of correct classifications
    - Correctly classified dog images
    - Correctly classified non-dog images
    - Accuracy of breed classification
6. **Prints the results** and **saves them in text files**.

**2Ô∏è. Running All Models Automatically**

You can automate classification for all three CNN models using batch scripts.

**Windows Users:** run_models_batch.bat

**Linux/macOS Users:** sh run_models_batch.sh

This will:

- Run check_images.py **three times** (once per model) for the provided images.
- Save results into:
  - resnet_pet-images.txt
  - alexnet_pet-images.txt
  - vgg_pet-images.txt
- Additionally, this script runs generate_results_chart.py, which takes as input the results from the 3 above txt files and generates a summary image: **results_summary.png**

**3Ô∏è. Running Custom Tests on Uploaded Images**

You can also test newly uploaded images:

- I added 4 new images under **Location:** uploaded_images/
- **Example images:** A dog (original + horizontally flipped), A non-dog animal and An object.

Run the script for uploaded images:

**Windows Users:** run_models_batch_uploaded.bat

**Linux/macOS Users:** sh run_models_batch_uploaded.sh

This will:

- Run check_images.py **three times** (once per model) for the newly uploaded images.
- Save results into:
  - resnet_uploaded-images.txt
  - alexnet_uploaded-images.txt
  - vgg_uploaded-images.txt

**üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting**

**Common Issues & Fixes**

| **Issue** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| ModuleNotFoundError for a package | Run pip install -r requirements.txt |
| FileNotFoundError: dognames.txt | Ensure you're running from the correct folder |
| OSError: No such file or directory | Use the correct --dir argument |
